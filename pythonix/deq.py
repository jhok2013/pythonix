"""Covers for the ``deque`` methods with type hints. Error, None, and type safe.

Does not return copies of the ``deque``, but instead mutable references
to the ``deq`` it recieves. A useful data structure with thread safe
appends and pops.

Examples: ::

    >>> deq = new(1, 2, 3)
    >>> val, nil = get(0)(deq)
    >>> val
    1
